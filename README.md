# IoT Analytics Server

A scalable IoT server built in Java for handling and analyzing real-time data from connected devices such as sensors and actuators.

The system is designed with object-oriented principles and supports multi-client communication, request prioritization, and efficient response handling.

## Features

- **Multi-client support:** Handles simultaneous connections from multiple IoT devices
- **Threaded request handling:** Uses multithreading to process device messages concurrently
- **Request prioritization:** Prioritizes time-sensitive messages from sensors and actuators
- **Thread-safe design:** Ensures safe shared access to resources
- **Socket-based communication:** Uses TCP sockets for client-server interaction

## Technologies

- Java (OOP)
- TCP Sockets
- Multithreading
- Synchronization & Thread Safety
